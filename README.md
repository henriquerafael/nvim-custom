### üìÅ Project Structure

The configuration is organized logically to make it easy to customize:

```
\~/.config/nvim
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lua/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lazy.lua      -- lazy.nvim plugin manager setup
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugins/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...           -- Each file is a plugin configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ keymaps.lua       -- Global keymappings
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ options.lua       -- Core Neovim settings
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ init.lua              -- The main entry point
```

To add a new plugin, simply create a new `.lua` file in the `lua/plugins/` directory. `lazy.nvim` will automatically load it.
